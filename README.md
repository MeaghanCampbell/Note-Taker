# Note-Taker

# Description
The note taker app is an express.js application that runs using node.js. It allows users to add notes on the front end, and then they save on the back end of the server in a json file. They are then posted again when the server reloads. Each note is given a unique ID on the back end.

# Installation
Clone github repo, run npm install, start server using NPM start, and visit local host.
